# C Things Library
Despite its many strengths, C is a low-level programming language that requires developers to implement data structures and algorithms from scratch. This can be both time-consuming and error-prone.

The C Things Library aims to address these challenges by providing an abstraction layer for common data structures and functionalities. Our library exposes a user-friendly and easy-to-use API, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without reinventing the wheel.
